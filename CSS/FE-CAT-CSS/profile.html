    <p>
      I love the city I grew up in because of the sea of activities it offers.
      There is always something happening in Barcelona!

      My hobbies are to paint and create unique pieces of pottery and clay
      products. I also make aromatic candles and try out new incenses 🧘🏻‍♀️
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion is art and creativity. Since I can remember I always loved to
      draw and paint 🎨

      My professional background is Tourism and masters in Marketing. I am
      currently working at a software company as Technical Specialist. However,
      I would love to explore other opportunities with this FrontEnd course. I
      would want to be able to create and bring in new ideas into the digital
      world 👩🏻‍💻
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to embark in this journey after having a short-lived love story
      with coding two years ago when due to Covid I had to stay home. I stumbled
      upon an online course SheCodes and fell in love. Unfortunately, when life
      was back to normal due to the busy schedule I was not able to pursue it.
      However, I am hoping that this course will have another happy ending for
      me 🧚🏼‍♀️
    </p>
    <p>I am very excited to start here and meet new people 👋🏼💬</p>
    <p>
      <strong> Let's go! 💪🏼 </strong>
